          <p>
            Hi, I'm Ethan Bayer. I'm a developer and independent musician
            interested in technology of all sorts as well as songwriting and
            music production.

              <h4>Conditional Switch</h4>
              <p>
                Conditional Switch is a video game made using the Unity game
                engine as well as C# for scripting. In total it took me a few
                months to finish, and you can play it in your browser or
                download the game for Windows and MacOS.

              <p>
                I made this website, my personal portfolio, from scratch with
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, which I learned
                over the course of a month thanks to the
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a>.

              <h4>AutoCompressors</h4>
              <p>
                AutoCompressors is a Spigot plugin for the video game Minecraft,
                adding new functionality in the form of easily customizable
                items that, when in your inventory, can automatically convert
                specific items into other ones.

              <h4>Ender-3</h4>
              <p>
                Over the course of a few years, I have heavily modified what
                originally was a Creality Ender-3 3D printer with both
                modifications developed by the incredible community around this
                printer as well as some of my own ideas and designs.

              <h4>3D Design</h4>
              <p>
                So far, I have designed and published six simple and useful 3D
                models to solve problems I had. I used Fusion for the designs
                and 3D printed them on my <a href="#ender-3">Ender-3</a>.

              <h4>Calculator Pong</h4>
              <p>
                I made a simple clone of Pong and coded it in TI-Basic for the
                TI-84 Plus <abbr title="Color Edition">CE</abbr> calculator.

              <h4>Other</h4>
              <p>
                I also program in Python for small projects, and I have
                experience with Git (both through graphical tools and the
                command line), the Linux and MacOS shells, and the router
                software OpenWRT.

              <h4>Castle On The Hill</h4>
              <p>
                I covered Ed Sheeran's song "Castle on the Hill" and released it
                as part of Grey Warren's album
                <span class="italic">The Songs We Leave Behind</span>. I sang
                and played guitar for the song, as well as helping produce the
                song.

              <p>
                I have played guitar for over nine years, and I have performed
                various times.
